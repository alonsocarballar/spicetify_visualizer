    * **Delay:** Micro-adjust audio/visual sync in milliseconds (useful for Bluetooth lag).

## Troubleshooting

* **Bars are missing?** Ensure you are playing a song. If the screen is black, try running `spicetify restore backup apply`.
* **UI not appearing?** The settings panel is hidden to keep the look clean. Move your cursor to the **extreme top-right corner**.
* **Colors won't change?** Toggle "Manual Color" on and then off again to force a fresh extraction of the album art colors.
* **Poor performance?** Make sure to turn on Hardware Acceleration on Spotify settings.
